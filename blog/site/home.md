# Introduction

Welcome to the AIML group's blog page! 

The goal of this site is to help current and future members of the AIML group at NCAR share programming lessons and tips. 

# About Us
The NCAR Analytics and Integrative Machine Learning group develops machine elearning systems to improve our understanding and prediction of the many facets of Earth's systems. Our group works in close collaboration with domain scientists across NCAR's labs, the university community, and the private sector to develop and integrate machine learning tools into modeling and observation pipelines. Our group members are:

* David John Gagne, Machine Learning Scientist II (CISL/RAL)
* John Schreck, Machine Learning Scientist I (CISL)
* Charlie Becker, Associate Scientist II (CISL)
* Gabrielle Gantos, Associate Scientist II (CISL)
* Maria Molina, Project Scientist I (CGD)
* Zhonghua Zheng, Postdoctoral Fellow (CISL/CGD)
* Will Chapman, Postdoctoral Fellow (CGD/CISL/RAL)
* Mariana Cains, Postdoctoral Fellow (MMM)
* Chris Wirz, Postdoctoral Fellow (MMM)
* Keely Lawrence, Student Assistant III (CISL, University of Colorado)
* Prahalath Bharathi, Student Assistant (CISL, Tufts University)
