    "\n",
    "SLURM is currently the scheduler on the Casper cluster, which means it is used to manage the queueing and scheduling of jobs. You are likely very familiar with sbatch and squeue at this point. SLURM also has a whole suite of other commands that give you an incredibly detailed view into the usage of the cluster by yourself and everyone else. This blog will provide some insights to help you better manage your own jobs and keep track of how busy Casper is."

    "`sacct` queries the SLURM scheduler database to find out how well you or any other user has utilized their requested resources on a job by job basis. The default output of sacct is not very useful, but with a few alterations to the command, you can get a wealth of information.\n",

Note that TotalCPU does not account for child processes, so if you are running multiprocessing or dask, this number may be deceptively low. \n",

If it is the same or close to the same as ReqMem and your job is taking a longer than expected time to run, the program may be swapping memory to disk. You should ask for more memory in that case. "

    "`sinfo` prints out information about the current usage of every node in the cluster. It is helpful to see which nodes have what resources, and you can see how busy each node is. This may be especially useful when you are about to launch a multi-GPU or large memory job and want to make sure the memory and GPUs are available. The default `sinfo` call provides a very high level summary. Just like `sacct`, I recommend running the following command:\n"
